**MENTOR NAME**:NEELA SANTHOSH KUMAR 

**DESCRIPTION**:

### **Multithreaded Chat Application**  

#### **Objective**  
Develop a real-time chat application using Java sockets and multithreading. The application should support multiple clients communicating with a central server, enabling seamless message exchange.  

#### **Tasks & Descriptions**  

1. **Understand Socket Programming & Multithreading**  
   - Learn about Javaâ€™s `Socket` and `ServerSocket` classes for network communication.  
   - Understand multithreading concepts to handle multiple clients simultaneously.  

2. **Set Up Java Development Environment**  
   - Install Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.  

3. **Implement the Chat Server**  
   - Create a server application that listens for incoming client connections.  
   - Use multithreading to handle multiple clients concurrently.  
   - Maintain a list of active clients and manage message broadcasting.  

4. **Develop the Client Application**  
   - Implement a client program that connects to the server via sockets.  
   - Allow users to send and receive messages in real-time.  

5. **Enable Message Broadcasting**  
   - Implement a mechanism to relay messages from one client to all connected clients.  
   - Ensure message delivery is synchronized across all users.  

6. **Improve User Experience with a GUI (Optional)**  
   - Develop a simple graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing or JavaFX.  
   - Display chat messages, provide an input box, and allow user interaction.  

7. **Implement Error Handling & Logging**  
   - Handle disconnections, server crashes, and invalid inputs gracefully.  
   - Use logging (`java.util.logging` or `SLF4J`) to track server activity and errors.  

8. **Test the Application**  
   - Run multiple client instances to verify simultaneous communication.  
   - Test for edge cases like abrupt disconnections or high user loads.  

#### **Deliverable**  
A functional Java-based chat application that:  
- Includes a multithreaded server handling multiple client connections.  
- Allows real-time message exchange between users.  
- Uses proper error handling and logging.  
- Optionally features a GUI for improved user interaction.
